# Pandas-library-

ðŸ“˜ My Pandas Practice Notebook
This notebook includes my practice and learning journey with Pandas, a powerful Python library used for data analysis and data manipulation. I worked on different small examples to understand how Pandas works and how to use it with real-world data.

ðŸ“Œ What You Will Learn from This Notebook:
âœ… How to import the Pandas library

âœ… Creating a DataFrame from a Python dictionary

âœ… Viewing and printing tabular data

âœ… Changing your working directory using os module

âœ… Saving a DataFrame as a CSV file using to_csv()

âœ… Understanding basic data handling and file operations

ðŸ§  What I Practiced:
In this notebook, I created a simple dataset of names, ages, and cities using a dictionary, converted it into a DataFrame, and then saved it into a CSV file. This helped me understand how data is stored and managed using Pandas.

I also learned how to use the os module to set the correct working folder on my computer, which is helpful when working with files like .csv.

ðŸŽ¯ Why I Made This:
I created this notebook to:

Practice basic concepts of Pandas

Build confidence while handling data

Prepare myself for data analysis projects

Improve my Python skills in data science
